How to Update the API Documentation
-----------------------------------

All of the docs used on the API documentation website is autogenerated using [apidocs.js][apidocs]. So, if the project source and the API docs website source are tracked separately, how do you update the docs. The following guide answers that question.

## Instructions:

*Note: If this isn't your first time skip step 1*

1. You'll need a local copy of the gh-pages branch
  ```bash
  git checkout -b gh-pages upstream/gh-pages
  ```

2. Next checkout the branch you're generating the docs from (ex master, 
develop)
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  ```

4. Checkout just the 'docs' folder from gh-pages
  ```bash
  git checkout gh-pages -- docs
  ```

3. Generate the new docs
  ```bash
  npm run apidoc
  ```

4. Change back to gh-pages
  ```bash
  git checkout gh-pages
  ```

5. Commit the changes

6. Push to your origin

7. Submit a PR

## Considerations:

The auto-generation process may have the tencency to modify a lot of source for seemingly small changes. As such, be sure to keep commits concise and well documented in the commit descriptions.
